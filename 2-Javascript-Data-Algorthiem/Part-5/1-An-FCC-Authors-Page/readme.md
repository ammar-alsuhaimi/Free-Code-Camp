+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

## **Purpose**

ne Common Aspect Of Web Development Is Learning How To Fetch Data From An External API, Then Work With Asynchronous JavaScript.
