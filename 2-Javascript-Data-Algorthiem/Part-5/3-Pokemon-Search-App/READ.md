## Build a Pokémon Search App

In this project, you'll create an application that allows users to search for Pokémon by either name or ID and display the results in a user-friendly interface. The app will retrieve Pokémon data and images using freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy.

### Key Features:
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for Pokémon by entering a name or ID.
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from the PokéAPI Proxy to get detailed information about each Pokémon, including images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Display the Pokémon data in a clear and accessible format.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure the app's content.
- **CSS**: Style the app and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implement the search functionality and handle API requests.

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand how to interact with APIs and fetch data.
- Gain experience in handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- Enhance skills in creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
