# **Spreadsheet Application Project**

## **Project Overview**


#### This Project Is A **Spreadsheet Application Project**, Developed As Part of The FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. 

#### The Primary Goal Is Spreadsheet App: Learn Functional Programming By Building A Spreadsheet 


## **Course Details**


+ **Course Section**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).
  
+ **Project Name**: Spreadsheet Application Project.
  
+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
  

## **Purpose**


Functional Programming Is A Popular Approach To Software Development. In Functional Programming, Developers Organize Code Into Smaller Functions, Then Combine Those Functions To Build Complex Programs.  

In This Spreadsheet Application Project, You'll Learn About Parsing And Evaluating Mathematical Expressions, Implementing Spreadsheet Functions, Handling Cell References, And Creating Interactive Web Interfaces. 

You'll Learn How To Dynamically Update The Page Based On User Input.  

This Project Will Cover Concepts Like The Map(), Find(), And Includes() Methods And The ParseInt() Function.
