# **Number Sorter Project**

## **Project Overview**


#### This Project Is A **Number Sorter**, Developed As Part of The FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. 

#### The Primary Goal Is You Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking By Building A Number Sorter


## **Course Details**


+ **Course Section**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).
  
+ **Project Name**: Number Sorter.
  
+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
  

## **Purpose**

In Computer Science, There Are Fundamental Sorting Algorithms That All Developers Should Learn. 

In This Number Sorter Project, You'll Learn How To Implement And Visualize Different Sorting Algorithms Like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, And Insertion Sort â€“ All With JavaScript.  

This Project Will Help You Understand The Fundamental Concepts Behind These Algorithms, And How You Can Apply Them To Sort Numerical Data In Web Applications.
