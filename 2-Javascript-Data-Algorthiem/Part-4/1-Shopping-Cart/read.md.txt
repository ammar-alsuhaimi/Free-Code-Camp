## **Project Overview**


#### This Project Is A **Shopping Cart**, Developed As Part of The FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. 

#### The Primary Goal Is You Learned Basic OOP By Building A Shopping Cart.



## **Course Details**


+ **Course Section**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).
  
+ **Project Name**: Shopping Cart.
  
+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
  

## **Purpose**

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. 

In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

In this shopping cart project, you'll learn how to define classes and use them. 

You'll create class instances and implement methods for data manipulation.

This project will cover concepts like the ternary operator, the spread operator, the this keyword, and more.
