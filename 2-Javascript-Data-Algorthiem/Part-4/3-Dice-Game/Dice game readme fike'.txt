# **Advanced-Dice-Game Project**


## **Project Overview**


#### This Project Is A **Advanced-Dice-Game**, Developed As Part of The FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. 

#### The Primary Goal Is Review Algorithms Thinking By Building A Advanced-Dice-Game.



## **Course Details**


+ **Course Section**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).
  
+ **Project Name**: Advanced-Dice-Game.
  
+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
  

## **Purpose**

Algorithmic thinking involves the ability to break down complex problems into a sequence of well-defined, step-by-step instructions.

In this Dice game project, youâ€™ll learn how to manage game state, implement game logic for rolling dice, keeping score, and applying rules for various combinations.

This project covers concepts such as event handling, array manipulation, conditional logic, and updating the user interface dynamically based on game state.
