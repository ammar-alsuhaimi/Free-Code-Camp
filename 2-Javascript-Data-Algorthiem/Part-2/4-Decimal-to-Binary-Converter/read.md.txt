# **Decimal To Binary Converter Project**

## **Project Overview**


#### This Project Is A **Decimal To Binary Converter**, Developed As Part of The FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. 

#### The Primary Goal Is Learn Recursion By Building A Decimal To Binary Converter.


## **Course Details**


+ **Course Section**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).
  
+ **Project Name**: Decimal To Binary Converter.
  
+ This Site Was Built Using **[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).**
  
+ This Project Is One of The **Required Tasks** To Earn The Certification In JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.
  

## **Purpose**

Recursion Is A Programming Concept Where A Function Calls Itself. 

This Can Reduce A Complex Problem Into Simpler Sub-Problems, Until They Become Straightforward To Solve.  

In This Project, You’ll Build A Decimal-To-Binary Converter Using JavaScript. 

You’ll Learn The Fundamental Concepts Of Recursion, Explore The Call Stack, And Build Out A Visual Representation Of The Recursion Process Through An Animation.
