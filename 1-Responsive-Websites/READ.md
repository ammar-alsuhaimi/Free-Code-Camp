# Responsive Web Design

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

*Note: Some browser extensions, such as ad-blockers and dark mode extensions, can interfere with the tests. If you face issues, we recommend disabling extensions that modify the content or layout of pages while taking the course.*
